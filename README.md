# README

This repository contains official code for our research paper "Synthesizing Long-Term Human Motions with Diffusion Models via Coherent Sampling" (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3581783.3611887).

## Environment setup
To set up the environment, we provide an `requirements.txt` file that you can use with pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Data preparation
Due to licensing restrictions, we are unable to provide pre-processed data directly. However, you can refer to [TEACH](https://github.com/athn-nik/teach#data) for specific data processing methods.

Eventually, you should have a folder `data` with such a structure:
```
data
|-- babel
|   `-- babel_v2.1
|       `...
|   `-- babel-smplh-30fps-male 
|       `...
|
|-- smpl_models
|   `-- smplh
|       `--SMPLH_MALE.pkl
```

Besides, you should download the folder `deps` in [TEACH](https://github.com/athn-nik/teach/tree/main/deps) to this project.

## Pre-trained weights
We provide the pretrained models here: [pretrained models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Lrj5FEt7bFFiv_VnfoDFoQgZzfF4X6RJ?usp=sharing). The 'pretrained.zip' file contains the pretrained model and training configurations used to report metrics in our paper, while 'MotionCLIP.zip' contains the model used for evaluation. You can put the pretrained model and training configuration file under `./save/pcmdm` and put the `MotipnClip.ckpt` under `./motionclip_save`.

## Running the code
You can use the following three commands to obtain the results for the last three rows of the experimental results table in our paper:
```
# No special sampling
python eval.py --model_path ./save/pcmdm/model000600000.pt --guidance_param 2 --inpainting_frames 0

# Past inpainting sampling
python eval.py --model_path ./save/pcmdm/model000600000.pt --guidance_param 2 --inpainting_frames 2

# Compositional transition sampling
python eval.py --model_path ./save/pcmdm/model000600000.pt --guidance_param 2 --composition True --inter_frames 2
```

Besides, if you want to train a model from scratch, you can use this comman:
```
python train_diffusion.py --save_dir ./save/pcmdm --dataset babel --hist_frames 5 
```
